Sue, George's mother...
do you remember George?

22
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:25,857
You went to science camp with
him. He was he smart kid.

Anyway, he remembers you
very fondly from science camp.

- No.

Um, Maria, you don't even know
what I was going to say next.

- No, she does.

Yes.

34
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:05,193
Here was my idea, just that
you're here and George...

35
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:07,595
is here and and you both like
each other...

36
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:10,764

you could go to it together.

37
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:13,667
- I'm not going to the prom.
- Why not?

38
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:17,138
Because it's stupid and I
don't want any part of it.

who you were.

you were there...

389
00:36:46,627 --> 00:36:50,963

look as pretty as a princess.

behind your back...

393

and roll her eyes when you
weren't looking.
